Wikipedia Scraping

The purpose of this project is to examine a corpus of Wikipedia articles with both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. It combines retrieval of pages using the Wikipedia API, uploading and downloading page info from a SQL database, searching for relevant pages given an input phrase, and match pages to categories.

download

./download [list of category names and/or .yml files from which to load category names]

The download script loops through a list of categories. For each, it queries the Wikipedia API for the list of pages associated with that category, then downloads and cleans the text from each of those pages. The category and individual page info is inserted into the SQL database.

search

./search [string of words]

The search script first loads the vectorized pages from the SQL database. It then vectorizes the input sting of words, and performs a comparison (through dot-product) to the pages in the database. The five strongest correlations are then output.

train-model

./train-model

The training script load the raw pages from the SQL database. It chooses all pages which correspond with a single category, and removes any categories with less than 10 associated pages. Each page's corpus is vectorized using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn, removing stop words and using a threshold for the minimum number of documents in which pages appear of [30,100,300,1000]. A cross-validated grid search is performed using K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees. The best model across all models and thresholds is saved as a pickle, along with the trained vectorizing transformer for the associated threshold.

predict

./predict [page_id for a Wikipedia page]

The prediction script loads the existing vectorizing transformer and most predictive model from pickles. It then loads the cleaned text from the input Wikipedia page, transforms it, and predicts the category.
